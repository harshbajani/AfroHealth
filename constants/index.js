      question: "What kind of benefits can I expect from taking AfroHealth?",
      answer:
        "AfroHealth provides support in five crucial areas of health: energy, immunity, gut health, hormonal and neural support, and healthy aging. At AfroHealth, we understand that everyone has a unique health history and reacts differently to various nutrients. AfroHealth is the original Foundational Nutrition drink and was designed as a comprehensive formula to provide daily support where the body needs it most. Many members report feeling sustained energy, having fewer cravings, and more balanced gut health over the course of the first month or so. Other common benefits include healthy skin, promoting hair and nail growth, improved concentration, and support recovery after physical activity. For those with a nutritional deficiency or digestive issues, benefits may be perceived more quickly.",
